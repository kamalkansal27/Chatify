-> Building the Chat Application using WebSockets.

-> WebSocket: WebSocket is bidirectional, a full-duplex protocol that is used in the same scenario of client-server communication, unlike HTTP it starts from ws:// or wss://. It is a stateful protocol, which means the connection between client and server will keep alive until it is terminated by either party (client or server). After closing the connection by either of the client and server, the connection is terminated from both ends. 

-> HTTP protocol: HTTP is unidirectional where the client sends the request and the server sends the response. Letâ€™s take an example when a user sends a request to the server this request goes in the form of HTTP or HTTPS, after receiving a request server send the response to the client, each request is associated with a corresponding response, after sending the response the connection gets closed, each HTTP or HTTPS request establish the new connection to the server every time and after getting the response the connection gets terminated by itself

-> Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.
